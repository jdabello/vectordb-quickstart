bikes\",\"specs\":{\"material\":\"aluminium\",\"weight\":\"10.0\"},\"description\":\"If you struggle with stiff fingers or a kinked neck or back after a few minutes on the road, this lightweight, aluminum bike alleviates those issues and allows you to enjoy the ride. From the ergonomic grips to the lumbar-supporting seat position, the Roll Low-Entry offers incredible comfort. The rear-inclined seat tube facilitates stability by allowing you to put a foot on the ground to balance at a stop, and the low step-over frame makes it accessible for all ability and mobility levels. The saddle is very soft, with a wide back to support your hip joints and a cutout in the center to redistribute that pressure. Rim brakes deliver satisfactory braking control, and the wide tires provide a smooth, stable ride on paved roads and gravel. Rack and fender mounts facilitate setting up the Roll Low-Entry as your preferred commuter, and the BMX-like handlebar offers space for mounting a flashlight, bell, or phone

This is the tiniest kids’ pedal bike on the market available without a coaster brake, the Jigger is the vehicle of choice for the rare tenacious little rider raring to go. We say rare because this smokin’ little bike is not ideal for a nervous first-time rider, but it’s a true giddy up for a true speedster. The Jigger is a 12 inch lightweight kids bicycle and it will meet your little one’s need for speed. It’s a single speed bike that makes learning to pump pedals simple and intuitive. It even has  a handle in the bottom of the saddle so you can easily help your child during training!  The Jigger is among the most lightweight children’s bikes on the planet. It is designed so that 2-3 year-olds fit comfortably in a molded ride position that allows for efficient riding, balanced handling and agility. The Jigger’s frame design and gears work together so your buddingbiker can stand up out of the seat, stop rapidly, rip over trails and pump tracks. The Jigger’s is amazing on dirt or pavement. Your tike will speed down the bike path in no time. The Jigger will ship with a coaster brake. A freewheel kit is provided at no cost.

It has a  Bafang 500 watt geared hub motor that can reach 20 miles per hour on both steep inclines and city streets. The lithium-ion battery, which gets nearly 40 miles per charge, has a lightweight form factor, making it easier for seniors to use. It comes fully assembled (no convoluted instructions!) and includes a sturdy helmet at no cost. The Plush saddle softens over time with use. The included Seatpost, however, is easily adjustable and adds to this bike’s fantastic rating for seniors, as do the hydraulic disc brakes from Tektro.
